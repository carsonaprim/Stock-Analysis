##Stock-Analysis

#Overview
This project our goal was to analyze Stock data from the given stocks in the years 2017 and 2018 to help our client figure out the right investments.
We are in turn learning how to perform advanced analysis on datasets that may be too large to sort through and perform regular excel functions with.
This is the process of learning VBA and using its ability to automate the process so that it may be used for either year or for any more years with the same data.

# Results
As far as the data goes, we can observe from the Refractored results that both the ENPH and the RUN stocks were positive gains over both of the years, with ENPH being the highest total growth when combined. Generally we can say 2018 was a bad year all around, with 2017 being a fairly amazing year for most of the stocks with 4 of them over 100% Return.

As far as the code goes, the refactored version ran approximately 6 times faster than the original when ran for 2018, meaning it was much smoother and executed efficiently.

To summarize, there is very much benefit to having the refactored code, as having code run faster and more efficiently can transition to it functioning better for larger datasets, and possibly saving a considerable amount of time in some situations. It seems to be worth the extra time spent to have it run smoother and be better equipped for the data. Refactoring in general seems to be a good way to have a middleground in time spent and originality, as if you can have some baseline already when coming in it can help the process, but considering you can't just ignore the code you inserted and have to tweak and edit it anyways, it definitely seems like an overall positive.
